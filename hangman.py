A crowd begins to gather, they can't wait to see some real justice.
There's just one thing, you aren't a real criminal.
No, no. You're the wrong time, wrong place type. You may think
you're doomed, but it's not like that at all.
Yes, yes. You've got a chance to live. All you've gotta do
is guess the right word and you can live to see another day.
But don't get too happy yet. If you make 6 wrong guesses,
YOU'RE TOAST! VAMANOS!
